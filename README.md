Python KD-Tree for Points
=========================

No external dependencies like numpy, scipy, etc...
and it's so simple that you can just copy and paste, or translate to other languages!

Your teacher will assume that you are a good student who coded it from scratch.

Just star this project if you find it helpful... so others can know it's better than those long winded kd-tree codes. ;)
